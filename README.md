# What is this
This is a Discord bot designed for the ~Informatik II course year 2021 of the Uni TÃ¼bingen~ server of FSI Reutlingen 

The goal is to implement features that help with talking about different topics related to programming

# Style guidelines
- The official Python style guidelines apply. There are several plugins for each editor that can help you with that
- Read PEP8 for naming
- Every new major feature belongs in it's own cog
- All cogs belong in ./cogs
- Copy the content of exampleCog.py.template as starting structure
- The readme in ./cogs must list what each cog in ./cogs does
