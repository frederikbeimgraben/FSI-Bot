# What is this
This is a Discord bot designed for the ~Informatik II course year 2021 of the Uni TÃ¼bingen~ server of FSI Reutlingen 

The goal is to implement features that help with talking about different topics related to programming

# How to participate
The master branch is supposed to be the stable branch, so make sure you don't modify it directly unless it doesn't influence the functionality

There is a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/M3wlcI77/info2bot) board for this project, so go take a look. If you find something you want to do, open up a new branch and start working. Once you got a stable version going, make a pull request

# Style guidelines
- The official Python style guidelines apply. There are several plugins for each editor that can help you with that
- Read PEP8 for naming
- Every new major feature belongs in it's own cog
- All cogs belong in ./cogs
- Copy the content of exampleCog.py.template as starting structure
- The readme in ./cogs must list what each cog in ./cogs does
